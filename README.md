# Washington_Facebook_SCI_Votes 2020
This is the final project for STAT/CSSS 567 Social Network Analysis at University of Washington




📰 Introduction
This is an interactive web map that marks the airports in the United States. Green means there is a traffic control tower (CNTL_TWR) at this airport while black means not. I use purple-blue color (from colorbrewer2.org) to create a chropleth map where darker purple indicates there are more airports in this state and lighter blue indicates there are fewer airports in this state. Users can click on the airport icon to see each airport's name and its three digit IATA code. The map can be accessed from here.

🔎 Data Resources
The county_county_Aug2020.tsv and the WA shp are too large to upload to github, you can download them here https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/12712f465fc44fb58328c6e0255ca27e_11;
