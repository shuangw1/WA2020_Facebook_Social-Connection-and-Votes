# Washington_Facebook_SCI_Votes 2020
This is the final project for STAT/CSSS 567 Social Network Analysis at University of Washington


The county_county_Aug2020.tsv and the WA shp are too large to upload to github, you can download them here https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/12712f465fc44fb58328c6e0255ca27e_11;

üì∞ Introduction
This is an interactive web map that marks the airports in the United States. Green means there is a traffic control tower (CNTL_TWR) at this airport while black means not. I use purple-blue color (from colorbrewer2.org) to create a chropleth map where darker purple indicates there are more airports in this state and lighter blue indicates there are fewer airports in this state. Users can click on the airport icon to see each airport's name and its three digit IATA code. The map can be accessed from here.

üîé Data Resources
airports.geojson contains all the airports in the United States. This data is converted from a shapefile, which was downloaded and unzipped from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile.
us-states.geojson is a geojson data file containing all the states' boundaries of the United States. This data is acquired from Mike Bostock of D3.
Basemap used cartocdn.

üî® Process
Code CNTL_TWR into two colors, "Y" for there are control towers and "N" for there are not.
Code States into 7 range colors.
Add interactive element, so you can click on the airplane icon and get information of the airports.
Library used including leaflet.ajax
üí° Analysis
It can be seen from the map that Alaska, California and Texas have the most number of airports. But the east coast airports have more traffic control towers, showing in green. Although Alaska has a lot of airports, but with few control towers, showing in black.
